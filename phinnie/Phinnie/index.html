      <h3>The Magic Dolphin</h3>
      <p>According to Rosaline Lee Fung, the creator of Phinnie, this magic dolphin is the beloved storyteller of the world.  Born in the South China Sea, he was kissed by the moon on his first leap out of the water.  Among the many gifts from the moon, Phinnie has eternal youth.  He has the wisdom of the ages and the charm of a little boy.  He befriends children of the world by sharing with them stories everywhere he goes.</p>
